#Meta-Documents
#-------------------------------------------
There are now five meta-documents:
    1. Outline
        This file contains the steps of the music handling process.
        It also documents how those functions are spread amongst our files.
        This could become more detailed as we understand our design better.
    2. TODO 
        Self-explanatory.
    3. Discussion 
        This is an area where we can leave each other notes and write down ideas.
        Facilitates our asynchronous communication.
    4. Notes
        The results of the discussion page end up here in condensed form. 
        Stylistic and design decisions can be documented here.
    5. ChangeLog
        A record of each file and function that has been changed along with a
        description of the changes and (if appropriate) commentary. 
        

#Stylistic Conventions
#-------------------------------------------
Capitalization and indentation:
    - 4-space indentation
    - camelCase for variables and function names
    - StudlyCaps for class names
Docstrings:
    - Every function, class and file should have a docstring. (Exception: __init__)
    - Every docstring should begin with a one-line description that summarizes
      the functionality or purpose of that item.
    - Docstrings should use correct grammar and punctuation.
    - The first line should use the imperative. ("Return sum" vs. "Returns sum")
    - After a blank line, more information can be included such as:
      the parameters, the return values, the side effects and the methods used.
    - Docstrings should always be followed by a blank line.


#Naming Conventions
#-------------------------------------------
On files:
    - paths should be named filePath(s), directoryPath(s) or itemPath(s) when type is ambiguous
    - filenames, which do not contain "/", should be named fileName(s), directoryNames(s) or itemNames(s)
    - entry is acceptable for elements in listdir results


#Lessons
#-------------------------------------------
    - List comprehensions are cool 
        Example - turning a dictionary of lists into a 1-D array:
        [filePath for key in filePathsByType for filePath in filePathsByType[key]]


#The Finished Product
#-------------------------------------------
What things should be true of the files and folders once we are done?
    
    - Exactly one album or disc's worth of content in each leaf directory
        - Multiple discs should be moved into their own folders
        - No tracks should be missing; if so the folder should be rejected
        - If audio files from different albums are present in the same folder, 
          they should moved into separate folders or be rejected
    
    - All albums should be in one (and only one) of two formats: OGG or MP3
        - Lossless formats (FLAC, APE, and WAV) should be converted to OGG -q 9
        - Lossy formats (MPC) should be converted to OGG -q 6
        - WMA should be deleted
        - If somehow there are two different formats (OGG & MP3) reject folder
        
    - The ID3 tags should be present, accurate and to standard
        - Certain tags should be always be present:
            - Artist
            - Album
            - Year
            - Genre
            - Track Title
            - Track Number
            - Total Number of Tracks
        - Some tags should never be present:
            - Copyright
            - URL
            - Encoder           
        - Some tags should be the same for all files in an album:
            - Artist
            - Album
            - Year
            - Genre
            - Total Number of Tracks
            
    - The file and folder names should be to standard:
        [Genre]
            [Artist]
                [Year] - [Album]
                    [Number] - [Title]
                    ...
                    [Number] - [Title]
                [Year] - [Album]
                ...
                   
    - Check for duplicates
        - If we are moving     
                
    - Final result should be moved to Sorted folder or into the Collection
