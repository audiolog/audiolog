#The Steps
#-------------------------------------------
0. Traverse It
    - Recurse through the directory tree using a Depth First Search
    - Execute the appropriate actions based on the file content in each directory
1. Extract It
	- Make a directory with the archive filename, extract into directory
	- Recursively extract all other archives within
2. Handle It
	- Split (if necessary)
	- Convert or delete based on format (if necessary)
	- Delete random files
	- If there are images, try to identify cover and rename to cover.jpg
3. Tag It
	- Try to get a PUID for tracks
	- Look up other metainformation from current track ID3s
	- Create a data structure that represents the metainformation for the current album
	- Get additional information from filenames and the directory structure and augment the data structure
	- Commit the metainformation to the files
4. Place It
	- See if it's in the collection, if it is choose the better version
	- Apply proper folder hierarchy
	- (If applicable) Move into the collection
