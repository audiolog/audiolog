"""Communication between threads and flow control.

This file contains functions to stop or pause the handler thread.
Because there is no good way from within the GUI thread to immediately pause or 
stop the handler thread, we instead use a pause lock and stop flag which the 
handler thread checks at regular intervals. This done by calling the checkpoint
function which will hang if the pause lock has already been acquired (and will 
stay there until it is released) and will raise a StopException if the stop 
flag is set. This exception is then caught in traverse.handleIt. Because these
actions will only be taken when the checkpoint function is called, pausing and
stopping happen quickly but not immediately.

The file also contains an emitter which is used by the handler thread to 
send signals which are caught by the GUI. The emitter is somewhat out of place
in this file but currently there is nowhere better to put it."""

    The cleanStopPoint parameter indicates that we are not in the middle of 
    processing a directory. Currently this is only true at the top of traverse.
    If the user asks to stop after the current directory (to stop "cleanly")
    then we will only stop if cleanStopPoint is True. If the user asks to stop
    now (the default), the handler thread will stop at the next checkpoint.
    The pauseOnly parameter indicates that we do not want allow processing to 
    be stopped now. Currently this is only used while we are writing tags."""
