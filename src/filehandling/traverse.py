"""Top-level handling control functions.

Handling begins when the GUI invokes handleIt with a list of directories to act
upon. This function calls traverse upon each. After determining what types of
files are present, traverse calls the proper functions to handle each type.
When this process ends - either after being stopped by the user, encountering
an error, or reaching completion - handleIt emits a signal to inform the GUI."""
