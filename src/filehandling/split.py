"""Support for splitting audio in which one disc of audio is in one file.

This file provides functions to split audio in one of two ways: based on a CUE
file or a wrapped audio file (AlbumWrap or MP3Wrap).
If there is one or more cues in a directory split is called to attempt to match
the cues to audio files and then to split them using the command-line 
program mp3splt."""
