"""Audio conversion support for multiple audio formats.

The convert function is called by traverse if audio in an undesirable format
is found. The currently supported source formats are: wav, flac, ape and mpc.
These formats are currently always converted into Ogg Vorbis but MP3 encoding
support is certain to be a popular demand if we release this publicly."""
