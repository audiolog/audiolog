"""High-level interface for accessing MusicBrainz.

getMBPUID looks up PUID returned by MusicDNS in MusicBrainz.

askMB constructs and executes a MusicBrainz query based on previously known 
data and/or potentially useful data.

Querying MusicBrainz is broken down into four or five parts:
    - Query construction
    - Fuzzy matching (if applicable)
    - Query execution
    - Post processing
    - Data gathering

Queries are constructed based on the requested field. Four parameters 
(artist, release, tracktotal, title) can be used directly in a Filter. 
The rest must be used in post processing.

A query is executed by first mapping Audiolog's standardized naming convention 
to MusicBrainz' (somewhat arbitrary) naming convention, depending on the 
requested record. Actually connecting to MusicBrainz occurs in contactMB.

Dates, track numbers, and titles are verified in post processing. For titles 
specifically, the contents of each release must be received and the titles must 
be verified one by one.

Finally, the requested field is extracted from the first found (best match) 
record, if MusicBrainz returned one that made it through post-processing.


==MusicBrainz Interface==

The system for using MusicBrainz is designed with 3 goals:
    1. Create one clean, simple, consistent interface for all callers and calls
       to use. The function askMB meets these goals.
    2. Allow for the most powerful possible uses of MusicBrainz even if they
       are not provided for or intended by the MusicBrainz interface 
       designers. We meet this goal in part by doing powerful post-processing
       of queries, which allows callers to provide dates or Track objects in
       the same manner as any other type of filter data even though
       MusicBrainz does not directly support this.
    3. Separate each step of the MusicBrainz process into its own function
       for ease of understanding and maintenance.
