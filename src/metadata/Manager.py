"""ReleaseManager manages the gathering and writing of one release's metadata.

The Overview

The metadata gathering process is the most important and most complex task
that Audiolog performs. The goal of this process is simple: Find complete,
accurate metadata for every track without any human intervention.

We begin with whatever (potentially incomplete and inaccurate) data currently
exists in the tags and filepaths. We attempt to match this data to entries in
the online music metadata datbase MusicBrainz. As we find results we are
confident are correct we use this "known data" to find the data that we do
not know yet.

The design of the ReleaseManager + Finders architecture is intended to
maximize our chances of finding all needed metadata. One of the key method
is to use a queue of Finder objects, one for each field that we do not yet
know. If a Finder fails to find the metadata for that field, then that
Finder is placed at the end of the queue to be tried again. The hope is that
by that time other fields will become known and this known data will allow
us to determine the field which we previously could not. 


The Picture

The relations between the classes and files used in this process are
illustrated below. Each component uses the component(s) in the box below it.
