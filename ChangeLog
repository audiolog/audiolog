    * release (findConsenus): Added code to remove date candidates which are not
    between 1600 and the current year + 1, inclusive. Should this be done
    somewhere else? And should the lower bound be 1600? (Some tracks are from 
    earlier; almost all are from much later.)

    * test_clean (test_clean): New file and function. Unit testing for
    clean.standardizeFilenames function.
    
    * test_extract (test_extract): New file and function. Unit testing for 
    extract.extract function.

    * traverse (traverse): Moved code to sort listdir entries.
    
    * functions (directory): New function containing code moved from traverse.

    * getters (matchMB): Made the variable matches a set instead of list to 
    enforce uniqueness. Moved the code to remove matches which are similar to
    the artist into an entirely separete block (which does two sweeps first 
    removing matches exactly the same as the artist and, if there are still
    two or more matches, matches which are aboutEqual to the artist). Then,
    at the end, we just check if there is only one match, and if there is, 
    we return it.

    * clean (lowercaseExtensions): Removed; merged into standardizeFilenames.
    
    * clean (standardizeFilenames): New function. Lowercases extensions,
    removes special characters and (mostly cooly) converts underscores and 
    periods being used in place of spaces into spaces.

    * ConfigurationDialog (browse): When changing other lineEdits relative to
    baseDir, I used a minor os.path hack to get a trailing slash in platform-
    independent way instead of just appending a "/" character.

    * functions (aboutEqual): Now uses restrictChars to remove punctuation
    and whitespace (and everything else but letters and digits).
    
    * getters (matchMB): Added a call to restrictChars to eliminate special 
    characters in the string we are trying to match. I did this because of
    an error I encountered when a filename with Asian (Chinese?) glyphs was
    passed as parameter to MusicBrainz. I'm not sure what characters exactly 
    MB does not want, but because we're are generally doing inexact matching 
    anyway, because unusual characters rarely if ever help a search and because
    MB generally can go from less to more but not vice versa, I thought
    restricting all MB queries to numbers, digits, punctuation and whitespace
    is not a bad idea.
    
    * functions (restrictChars): New function. This function takes six 
    parameters: the string we are restricting, then four booleans indicating
    whether to allow letters, digits, whitespace, and punctuation, respectively,
    and finally a string of additional characters to allow. All but the first
    of these parameters is optional. The booleans all default to true and the
    custom string to None.

    * LogFrame: Added drop-down to select output level. Implemented filtering.
    
    * LogFrame (addToLog): New function. Takes an entry, applies filter and
    potentially adds to textEdit. This used to be a part of appendToLog but I
    wanted to be able to use this functionality from updateLog as well so I
    moved it to its own functions.
    
    * LogFrame (log): Added log argument.

    * All non-GUI files: Changed calls to log to add a level argument.

    * Every file: Added file docstring and converted all function docstrings 
    to standard. (See: Notes)

2009-04-03  Rob Nagle
    
    * extract: Significantly restructured file. Instead of using a
    dictionary of extractor functions, we now use a dictionary of extractor
    commands. This was done because there was significant duplication of code
    across the extractor functions. The makeDestDirectory function has also
    been removed and all functionality now occurs inside the extract function.
    
    * convert: Restructured file in a similar fashion to above. 
    
    * split (split): Code for moving multiple cue/audio pairs into separate
    disc directories has been generalized and moved into its own function.
    
    * functions (moveDiscsIntoFolders): New. This could be useful in dealing
    with multiple discs in the audio handling process.

    * flowcontrol (clear): Function renamed to initialize.

    * traverse (traverse): Reworked if clauses to check for desirable audio
    sooner, potentially saving time and allowing later clauses to be shorter. 

    * traverse (traverse): Removed debugging statements which printed the
    contents of subdirectoryPaths, filePaths and filePathsByType. This code was
    moved to oldCode. It seems clear by now that those container variables are 
    being populated correctly and the code is now more clear and concise.

    * LogFrame (__init__, displayAll): Added a "Display All" Button which, when
    clicked, calls the new displayAll method which sets all category checks.

    * ChangeLog: Created change which follows open source standards. See:
    http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/changelogs/guile-changelogs_3.html
    
    * TODO: Organized entries into categories, added new entries and added
    more detail to others. I think it is a good idea to be very specific in TODO
    entries. This makes it easier for us to implement and to know what the other
    has in mind.
